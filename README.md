<h2>Hi There!</h2>

About Me - 
I am a student at Eastern Technical High School and my main goal with GitHub is to learn as much as I can about technology as I have aspirations to enter either cybersecurity and IT or software and web development.

Prior Experience - 
So far in school I am taking introduction classes in CISCO IOS, basics of IT Networking, and python. I have also been on the side learning html, css, and javascript trying to broaden my understanding of the innerworking of the internet.
